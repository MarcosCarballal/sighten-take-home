Consider all of the following code snippets in the context of having access to the `Project`, `GenerationProject`, and `Quote` models. I won't write the imports for each of these models

## 1.
```python
all_quotes = Quote.objects.all()
```
## 2.
```python
thousand_quotes = Quote.objects.filter(install_cost__exact=1000)
```

* "This spanning can be as deep as you like"
* I'm just learning this about Django's ORM and this is an awesome feature. My understanding is that you can just keep scanning over fields without having to explicitly define any kind of join. 

```python
cap_gte_15_quotes = Quotes.objects.filter(project__name__generation_project__gt = 15)
```

The `related_name` field in `Class Quote` allows us to traverse the many-to-one relationship "In reverse"

```python
proj_qic_gt_15k = Projects.objects.filter(quotes__install_cost__gt = 15000)
```

# <h1> Q3 </h1>
Assume we have the following Tables in our Schema

**project**
* id (int, PK)
* name (varchar(64))
* generation_project_id (FK of generation_project id field, Nullable)

**generation_project**
* id (int, PK)
* capacity (int, default=0)
* input_mode = varchar(10) // You could add additional constraints here (or use a boolean since there are only two choices)
  
**quote**
* id (int, PK)
* project_id (int, FK of project id field)
* install_cost (float)
  

### Implementing Part 7 from Question 2 in raw SQL.

```sql
	WITH (
		SELECT p.id AS id, AVG(q.install_cost) AS average_cost 
		FROM project p 
		JOIN quote q
		ON p.id = q.project_id
		GROUP BY p.id
	)
	AS p_quote_avg
	SELECT * FROM project p, p_quote_avg pqa
	WHERE p.id = pqa.id AND pqa.average_cost > 15000
```
The above method is probably not the most effective way of writing this query. But I imagine this all gets optimized away by SQL's query engine anyways.
