The most exciting piece of technology that I have been researching lately is the [Julia programming language](https:/julialang.org). The Julia language is new to me, but the project has its origins at MIT in 2009. The Julia language provides an awesome programmatic interface for many mathematical, data science, and scientific domains. It provides functioning "out-of-the-box" rendering of its primitive types, and most packages will also provide methods to render the objects that you are working with. This makes developing in Julia a rewarding, visual and interactive experience. I've been working through the publicly available [Julia course through MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-972-algebraic-techniques-and-semidefinite-optimization-spring-2006/syllabus/) and have really enjoyed getting to play around in this language.
